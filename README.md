# Introduction to the Crowd4SDG Citizen Science Solution Kit

A citizen science (CS) project leader is a person, group of persons, or organization who is interested in carrying forward a CS project. The Citizen Science Solution Kit (CSSK) is a set of tools built, curated, and maintained by the [Crowd4SDG](https://crowd4sdg.eu) project with the objective to help a CS project leader to successfully advance a CS project. Each of the tools focuses on a common recurring need of CS project leaders given in the table below:

CS project leader needs to | Tool 
--- | --- 
Increase the involvement of citizens into the management of the project | decidim4CS
Enroll a volunteer community to perform a complex data classification task | Project Builder
Analyze data obtained from a volunteer community | Crowdnalysis
Extract visual evidence about a situation from images on Twitter,<br />filtering out irrelevant images, and geotagging them | VisualCit
Document the progress of the CS project | decidim4CS,<br />SDG in Progress

## Project Builder

The [Citizen Science Project Builder](https://lab.citizenscience.ch) (PB) is a web-based tool that allows researchers, students, and all members of the public to create and run data-analysis for a CS project. Such projects may take many different forms, from classifying images of snakes to transcribing handwritten German dialect, from collecting samples of water to taking pictures of insects and plants. Typically, volunteer contributors are asked to perform complex data classification task (ie. classify, tag, describe, or geo-localize) that are still best performed by human minds and skills. In particular, the PB supports projects based on existing digital data that can be in the form of images, text, PDF documents, social media posts (tweets), sounds and video clips. The PB provides an interface that requires limited technical knowledge, and ideally little or no coding skills. 

## VisualCit

Getting first-hand information about an emergency situation while it is happening is important, but is often difficult to obtain in time. VisualCit, the image-based social sensing toolkit, allows extracting visual evidence about a situation from Twitter. It focuses on the selection, geolocalization and analysis of images extracted from Twitter.

Further details of the tool can be found [here](http://pernici.faculty.polimi.it/crowd4sdg-tools-polimi/). For the open-source software, please refer to [this](https://gitlab.iiia.csic.es/crowd4sdg/polimipipeline) code repository.

## decidim4CS

[decidim4CS](https://decidim4cs.iiia.csic.es) is a free digital platform for participatory citizen science and it constitutes the deliberation technology used in the Crowd4SDG project. It allows citizen scientists to involve democratically in science projects by providing a plethora of participation options, such as making proposals, scheduling public meetings, making decisions through different forms of voting, and monitoring the implementations of these decisions. decidim4CS is based on [decidim](https://decidim.org), a free open-source software created by the Barcelona City Hall as a participatory democracy platform for cities and organizations.

Open-source code of decidim4CS is available at [this](https://github.com/Crowd4SDG/decidim4cs) public GitHub repository. 

## Crowdnalysis

The main aim of Crowdnalysis is to ease the statistical analysis of the data gathered by the Project Builder, in order to help the scientist managing the CS project to get the most accurate information from the contributions of volunteers. Specifically, Crowdnalysis is an open-source software [library](https://github.com/Crowd4SDG/crowdnalysis) that provides advanced probabilistic consensus models to aggregate volunteer annotations in CS projects. 

## SDG in Progress

[SDG in Progress](https://sdginprogress.com) is a platform for anyone who wants to document projects they are carrying out towards tackling the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), or who wants to get inspired by other people’s projects, re-use them or re-purpose them. There are many ways to document projects: wikis, GitHub etc. The point of SDG in Progress is to build up an open repository of SDG projects, which may involve hardware and software development, or focus more on grassroots or policy initiatives. The idea is to inspire creativity, while minimizing redundancy.

### Funding
